# Protein-ligand binding free energy calculations (Single Trajectory method) with CHARMMff files
In this case, gmx_MMPBSA requires:

* An input parameters file (*.in) -- input file containing all the specifications regarding the type of calculation that
is going to be performed
* The MD Structure+mass(db) file (*.tpr, *.pdb, *.gro) 
* An index file (*.ndx) -- *.ndx file containing the receptor and ligand in separated groups
* Receptor and ligand group numbers in the index file
* A trajectory file (*.xtc, *.pdb, *.gro, *.trr) -- final GROMACS MD trajectory, fitted and with no pbc.
* A topology file (*.top) -- take into account that *.itp files belonging to the topology file should be also present in the folder

_See a detailed list of all the flags in gmx_MMPBSA command line [here](https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/gmx_MMPBSA#calling-gmx_mmpbsa-from-the-command-line)_

That being said, once you are in the folder containing all files, the command-line will be as follows:

    gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.xtc -cp topol.top

where the `mmpbsa.in` input file, is a text file containing the following lines:

```
Sample input file for PB calculation
#This input file is mean to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Althought, we tried to used the input files as recommended in the 
#Amber manual, some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations. Feel free to change the parameters 
#according to what is better for your system.

_See a detailed list of all the options in gmx_MMPBSA input file [here](https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/gmx_MMPBSA#the-input-file) 
as well as several [examples](https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/gmx_MMPBSA#sample-input-files)_

In this case, a single trajectory (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand structures and 
trajectories will be obtained from that of the complex. To do so, a MD Structure+mass(db) file (`com.tpr`), an index file (`index.ndx`),
a trajectory file (`com_traj.xtc`), and both the receptor and ligand group numbers in the index file (`1 13`) are needed.
The `mmpbsa.in` input file will contain all the parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation.

PB model is recommended when working with CHARMMff files. Please, check this [thread](http://archive.ambermd.org/201508/0382.html) 
and proceed cautiously.

Once the calculation is done, the GUI app (gmx_MMPBSA_ana) will show up. In this app, you can visualize the results for 
the GB calculation. The results can be saved as *.csv file by clicking "File" in the upper left corner and then 
"Export GB/PB energy (csv)".
