## This is the tutorials folder. Here you can find a representation of almost all the types of calculations that you can perform with gmx_MMPBSA. Although each tutorial focuses on specific examples, you can use gmx_MMPBSA on systems that combine a number of characteristics (i.e. metalloprotein:ligand complex, Protein-DNA-ligand, etc.)
